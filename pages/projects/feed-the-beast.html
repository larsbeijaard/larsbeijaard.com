                    <h3>The Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was a school project which you had to make in teams. Our team existed of 3 developers and
                        2 artists. I had a fun time making this project. And have also learned quite a bit. The theme of the
                        project was laying around 'make a local multiplayer game', which is a wide theme. So we gathered
                        around the table and discusses what we wanted to make. After a bit of discussing we came to the
                        conclusion that we wanted to make a FFA. In the game you need to gather as much food as you can
                        and bring it to your bowl. When the timer is over, the person with the least amount of food would get
                        eaten by the dragon, until one person is lasted.

                    <h3>What have I learnt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since we worked in a team, you needed to know what everyone was doing in order to not mess someones
                        work up or do things that are not necessary. So we had strong communication and used
                        <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> to see what the others were doing and how
                        far they were with that.

                        So, shortened, I have learned more about how important it is to have strong communication when working
                        in a team project.
