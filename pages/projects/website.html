                    <h3>The Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        I had very much fun making this portfolio website. The hard part was deciding what theme I wanted to
                        go for. I think I reworked the style about 3 times. But after finding the right
                        theme, I went for it.
                        <br><br>
                        I made this project from scratch with zero idea of how to make a website. So first, I needed to learn
                        the HTML and CSS language, so I took a free courses at CodeCademy.com. When I completed those courses
                        I had a pretty good understanding on how to make and design a website.

                    <h3>What have I learnt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As I mentioned earlier, I began with zero knowlegde about making a website from scratch. So I took
                        the free courses there were on CodeCademy.com.
                        <br><br>
                        Meaning that I have learned 2 languages, which are HTML and CSS. Besides those 2 languages, I have
                        learned how to cheat the system. By that I mean, I have learned how to specificaly design your
                        website with the right HTML elements in order to let Google put your website up front and above
                        others. Its called 'semantic HTML'. Its basically using the right elements in your website, so
                        Google can easily see what content there is on your website.
